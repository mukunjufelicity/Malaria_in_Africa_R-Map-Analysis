# Malaria_in_Africa_R_GIS

**OVERVIEW:**
This project's object is to analyze the Spread of Malaria in Africa from a Kaggle sourced dataset. The dataset will have aspects of spatial analysis to understand the distribution and patterns of malaria cases in different regions of Africa.

The dataset will undergo preprocessing and exploratory analysis, which will aid in getting helpful insights. The project's main focus is to show the various countries in Africa that are mostly affected by the spread of Malaria. 

**REQUIREMENTS:**
Showcase visual, displaying countries in Africa affected by Malaria. 

**KPIs:**
Q: From the visual, which African countries are mostly affected by the spread of Malaria?

Q: What are the summary statistics of malaria cases?

Q: What is the total number of malaria cases?

**FINDINGS & PROPOSALS:**
- Initiated the worklfow by installing the necessary R packages and imported the sourced dataset.
- Under preprocessing, I explored the structure of the data, had a summary of the data for better understanding.
-
